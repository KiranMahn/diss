\subsubsection{User Requirements Results}

The user requirements survey was sent out to 11 participants, and the results are shown in Table \ref{table:user-requirements}. The survey was designed to gather information about the participants' experiences with perimenopause and menopause, as well as their preferences for tracking symptoms.

        \end{tabular}

  \end{table}

The results show that the majority of participants are in the perimenopausal stage, and most experience symptoms related to this stage. The survey also revealed that many participants do not currently track their symptoms, indicating a potential need for a user-friendly tracking app.

\subsubsection{Round 1: Web App Evaluation}
For the first round of app evaluation, 5 users who were women between the ages of 30 and 65 were recruited to watch a demo video of the app and fill out a SUS and a few long answer questions with their feedback. These participants were recruited via email and were asked to read through a participant information sheet before participating.

\begin{table}[h!!]
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    SUS Scores(n=5) &      \\ \hline
                    & 67.5 \\
                    & 85   \\
                    & 72.5 \\
                    & 77.5 \\
                    & 65   \\
        Average Score & 73.5
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

From the average SUS score of 73.5, it is clear that the app is usable as it's in the top 27\% of scores, but it could be improved.

\subsubsection{Round 2: React Native Evaluation with Group A}

After obtaining these results, changes were made to the app's look and feel and more instructions were included. AB Testing was then conducted with more participants to see if the changes made had a positive impact on the SUS score. 

**Will put results here** 

\subsubsection{Round 3: React Native Evaluation with Group B}
After implementing the feedback from Group A, the app was then tested with a new group of participants. This group was also asked to fill out a SUS and long answer questions about their experience with the app. The goal of this round of testing was to see if the changes made had a positive impact on the usability of the app.

The changes made included: 

The app was then rated according to the MARS rating system and compared to the other app rated at the beginning of the study. **Results here**
