\section{Results \& Evaluation}\label{results}

\subsection{Evaluation Process}
For the first round of app evaluation, 5 users who were women between the ages of 30 and 65 were recruited to watch a demo video of the app and fill out a SUS and a few long answer questions with their feedback. These participants were recruited via email and were asked to read through a participant information sheet before participating.

\begin{table}[h!!]
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    SUS Scores(n=5) &      \\ \hline
                    & 67.5 \\
                    & 85   \\
                    & 72.5 \\
                    & 77.5 \\
                    & 65   \\
        Average Score & 73.5
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

From the average SUS score of 73.5, it is clear that the app is usable as it's in the top 27\% of scores, but it could be improved.

After obtaining these results, changes were made to the app's look and feel and more instructions were included. AB Testing was then conducted with more participants to see if the changes made had a positive impact on the SUS score.

The app was then rated according to the MARS rating system and compared to the other app rated at the beginning of the study. **Results here**
